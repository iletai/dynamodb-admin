- **Log Management**: Clear logs functionality with confirmation

### Logged Operations

- Scan operations with filter expressions and limits
- Query operations with key conditions
- Item CRUD operations (get, put, delete)
- Table management operations (create, delete)
- Execution time and response count tracking

## Next Steps and Potential Work
